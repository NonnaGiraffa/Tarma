# Tarma
Tarma is a small CUI tool to list, name, tag and save description about books and documents.

**How to get started?**<br>
```
Simply download the source code, written in python, and execute it.
In the execution directory a new folder called "Tarma" should come up.
Then, follow the intuitive instructions that the program offers.
```

**Features**
```
- Write new data.
- Read saved data.
- List all saved data.
- Sort data by rating.
    - Sort everything.
    - Sort Books or Non-Books only.
- Clear written data.
```

**Am I using this?**
```
Yes, I am and will use Tarma to save what I think of the books I read.
```

**Should *you* use this?**
```
If you want to you can, but of course I have no responsibility for any data losses.
Still, I have found no bugs.
```

**Will this get updated?**<br>
```
No, it won't, unless a group of people is interested and using the project.
This was just a way for me to spend some time, and it was never intended to have a big scale.
The (small) project was built in 4 hours only, from the gorund up.
```

**No bugs?**
```
The project is so simple it doesn't seem to have any bugs.
If you find any, please let me know, I'll fix it.
(Or maybe fork it yourself and have fun :D)
